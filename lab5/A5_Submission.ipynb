    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "1. Refine the given implementaion of the A* search by outputting the number of nodes expanded on the way to the goal ('green' cell) and the total cost of the path.\n",
    "2. Implement a different version of the A* search which uses a Manhattan distance as the heuristic function. Compare the results with previous version of the algorithm. Visualize the path using differrent colors for its components (from the start to goal1, from the goal1 to.., etc.)\n",
    "3. Create the refined Maze:\n",
    "* the food locations are 10% of the space and distributed randomly (even the start and finish points may contain food).\n",
    "* there are 5 Ghosts hidden (the Agent can't figure out the location of the GHost) in the Maze (randomly, but not in the start and finish points, the locations of Fixed Food Dots and Ghosts must also be different).\n",
    "4. The Pac-man Agent must find all Fixed Food Dots and then find the finish point (the results of task 2 are supposed to be used). The search of Fixed Food Dots must be rational: the 1st 'food' goal must be the most cost-optimal among other Food Dots.\n",
    "5. The inital perforamnce of Agent is 20% of space cells. After reaching a Fixed Food Dot the agent's performance doubles. If the Agent encounters Ghosts, it fights. But only the strong Agent (with performance > 30% of space cells) can win. Otherwise the Agent will be killed by Ghost. If the Agent wins, he will lose 10% of his previous effectiveness after the battle.\n",
    "6. Implemet IDA* or RBFS (the algorithm is assigned to the team during the lab class) search and apply it for tasks 4-5."
